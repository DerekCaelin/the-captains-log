# the-captains-log
A Unity Game about a captain and crew lost in space, searching for a way home.

The Captain's Log was my first large-scale solo project, inspired by watching Star Trek: Voyager with my wife and musing about what a great game long journey's might make. I worked on it for a year, from September 2014 to October 2015, and learned a lot on the way about procedurally generated writing (and reining in ambition.) The game is far, far from what I wanted it to be but may be of interest for those who want to want to see what a procedurally generated story looks like.

I'd love it if someone took the game, added to it, and improved it. I will be happy to support anyone who wants to do something with it. Please reach out to me on twitter @derekpost.

Game Description:

"The Captain's Log sets the player as the captain of a star ship that has been lost in space. Find your way home, scavenging for resources, upgrading your ship, embarking on dangerous missions and scouting out worm holes. As you play, the captain will record in his/her log updates about the day, dynamically reacting to the events of the story.

"The Far Jump was supposed have taken us to a neighboring system, only a few hundred light-years away. And here we are, 80,000 lightyears from home."

"After his ship sank in the Antartic, Shackleton kept his crew of twenty-eight alive for a year on little more than seal meat and stubbornness. Now we have to summon up our own measure of perseverance."

"We called the fourth planet of the Subedes system 'Anna' after Lieutenant Galleck, who first detected it on our scans."
