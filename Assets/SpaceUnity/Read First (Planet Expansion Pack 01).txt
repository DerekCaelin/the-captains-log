 PLANET EXPANSION PACK 01      (for SPACE UNITY - Space Scene Construction Kit)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Thank you for purchasing this expansion pack :) Although you can use these
 textures and materials separately they are design to integrate and act as
 an expansion to "SPACE UNITY - Space Scene Construction Kit" for Unity3D. 

 If you don't own SPACE UNITY, have a look at this asset in the Unity Asset
 Store to get the most out of this expansion pack:

 This first expansion pack contains 28 new planets all with high resolution
 (4096x4096) diffuse maps, normal maps, and optional night city and lava
 illumination maps.

 INSTRUCTIONS:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Import this package to your "SPACE UNITY" project which contains the
    editor extension and default content such as stars, nebulas, galaxies,
    planets, etc.

 2. The hierarchy in the package is design so the materials and textures will
    end up in the correct place and the editor extension will automatically
    index the new materials in this expansion pack next time you open the
    Space Scene Construction Kit window.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Have fun with your new planets and I hope you find good use for them in your
 games.
